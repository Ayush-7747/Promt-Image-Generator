# 🧠 Student Coding Room Image Generator

This project provides a Jupyter Notebook that generates a highly detailed and imaginative prompt for AI-based image generation tools like DALL·E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion. The prompt creates a vivid mental picture of a student coding in a cozy, moody room — perfect for use in AI art generation, storytelling, or concept design.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Open the notebook `img gen.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. Inside the notebook, a single Python cell contains the descriptive text prompt.
3. Run the notebook to view and optionally edit the prompt as needed.
4. Copy the prompt and paste it into any AI image generator platform (such as DALL·E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion).
5. Get a stunning AI-generated visual of a student coding in their room!
